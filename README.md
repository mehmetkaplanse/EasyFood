##### EasyFood Mobile Application 

## Libraries and technologies used to build this app
- Programming language : Kotlin
- Navigation component : One activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites
- Retrofit : Making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object
- Room : Save meals in local database
- MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes
- Coroutines : Do some code in the background
- View binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that
- Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView
